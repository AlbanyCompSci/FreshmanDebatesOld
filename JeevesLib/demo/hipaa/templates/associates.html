	This page is for showing the business associates
	that an entity has an agreement with. If an associate is also a covered
	entity, it has a link to more information regarding it. Each agreement with
	a busines associate has information that the entity and business associate
	share so the business associate can fulfill the agreement.
	If information access is restricted to the accessor, the information
	shared cell can contain the reason the information is being restricted.
